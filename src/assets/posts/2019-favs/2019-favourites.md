As a list-nerd, music-nerd and playlist-creating-nerd (I have a bunch of public ones on my <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/1190591101?si=0PTypo6WQfyNvKg6yXbO1g" target="_blank">Spotify Account</a>), every year I like to round up my thoughts on what was my favorite music released during that year.

This is not a "best of 2019" list or anything like that, but rather the music from this year that I listened to the most and that made a more significant impact on me.
