Welcome to my newly launched personal website and blog!

## What to expect

This will be a space for sharing.

Be that sharing what my most recent Javascript finding is, what awesome album I discovered this week or where I traveled to last weekend, you can expect some rambling and hopefully some informative content as well.

## Built with Gatsby

I took this opportunity to try out <a href="https://gatsbyjs.org" target="_blank">Gatsby</a>, an awesome open source React framework.

A special thank you goes out to Andrew Mead for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t0vNu2fCCM" target="_blank">The Great Gatsby Bootcamp</a>, his awesome tutorial on the subject.

You can check the source code for this project on my <a href="https://github.com/toanjo/toanjo.dev" target="_blank">github</a>.
