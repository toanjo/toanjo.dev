Welcome to my newly launched personal website and blog!

## What to expect

This will be a space for sharing.

Be that sharing what my new favourite Javascript framework is, what awesome album I discovered this week or where I traveled to last weekend, you can expect some rambling and hopefully some informative content as well.

## Built with Gatsby

I took this opportunity to try out Gatsby, an awesome open source React framework.

A special thank you goes out to Andrew Mead for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t0vNu2fCCM" target="_blank">The Great Gatsby Bootcamp</a>, his awesome tutorial on the subject.
